# Thesis Facts - SPVR01 (Paulsson, MA thesis)

Digest of the thesis for Ideophone Arena design, copy, and data work. Compiled 2026-06-11 from the thesis page scans (OCR sidecars) in project knowledge. Values marked **[chart-read]** were read off bar-chart figures and are accurate to roughly ±1 count / ±0.1 rating; replace them with exact values when the raw data export lands (see Open Questions).

## 1. Experiment in one paragraph

36 participants with no knowledge of Japanese completed two tasks on the Gorilla platform (~20 min total): a 30-trial two-alternative forced-choice **Choosing Task** (pre-reflective measure: guess which of two ideophones matches a target English meaning), then a **Rating Task** (reflective measure: "How much does this word sound like what it means?", 7-point scale, 1 = no resemblance, 7 = very high). Between-subjects condition (3 levels): Audio-Only (C1, n=11), Congruent Script (C2, n=13), Incongruent Script (C3, n=12). Within-subjects: modality (auditory / visual / interoceptive, 10 pairs each). Task order was fixed (Choosing first) so the Rating Task's revealed meanings could not contaminate naive guessing. Audio: Google Cloud TTS, female Japanese WaveNet voice `ja-JP-Wavenet-B`, chosen to match McLean, Dunn & Dingemanse (2023: 719).

## 2. Stimulus construction pipeline (matters for inventory expansion)

1. NINJAL-LWP for BCCWJ (NLB) "onomatopoeia" search → top 600 most frequent ideophones.
2. Each transcribed in both kana scripts; hiragana-vs-katakana frequency measured per word on JaTenTen11 via Sketch Engine → script-preference measure.
3. Selection criteria: (a) three modalities along the implicational hierarchy (auditory, visual, interoceptive); (b) katakana-preferring words shortlisted (~20 per modality); (c) monosemous and modality-specific; (d) JMdict vetting - cross-modal polysemes excluded (e.g. *garan* "clanging" + "deserted"), ambiguous English glosses excluded.
4. Each katakana-dominant word paired with a meaning-contrastive, usually hiragana-dominant counterpart **in the same sensory domain** (e.g. kirakira/katakana/bright vs donyori/hiragana/gloomy). Pairs verified against corpus script frequencies and reviewed with a native speaker.
5. Result: 30 pairs (60 words), 10 per modality, every pair contrasting in both meaning and script dominance. Plus 4 practice pairs (8 words, p0–p3) excluded from analysis.

**Implication for the pairing pipeline (roadmap step 5):** the top-600 spreadsheet's columns (NLB frequency, script frequency, modality, perceptual strength) are exactly the inputs this manual process used. An automated pipeline replicates steps 3–4: filter by modality, monosemy-check, script-dominance contrast, same-modality semantic contrast. The semantic-contrast step was first/second-person judgment in the thesis - the one step that resists full automation and will need human (Nils) sign-off per generated pair.

## 3. Headline results (safe for copy, verified in thesis text)

- **H1 supported - above-chance guessing.** Mean Choosing accuracy ≈ 64% (19.25/30) vs 50% chance. Every participant's mean exceeded the benchmark except the single lowest (14/30 ≈ 47%, essentially at chance); best performers reached ~27/30 (≈90%).
- **H2 supported - modality ordering.** Accuracy: Auditory 6.86 > Visual 6.42 > Interoceptive 5.97 (out of 10). Consistent with the implicational hierarchy (Dingemanse 2012; McLean 2021): unimodal sound-to-sound mappings are most transparent, internal states least.
- **H3 not supported - orthography had negligible group-level effect on accuracy.** Exact condition means (full data): Audio-Only 63.6%, Congruent 63.6%, Incongruent 65.3% - if anything, the mismatched-script group did trivially (not significantly) better. Predicted ranking C2 > C1 > C3 did not appear; high and low performers appeared in all three groups.
- **Rating Task reversal (the thesis's most game-worthy finding).** Mean ratings by modality: Interoceptive 4.45 > Visual 4.24 > Auditory 4.08 - the *opposite* ordering from accuracy. Interoceptive words *feel* most iconic but are guessed worst. Grand mean rating 4.26/7.
- **Script dampened felt iconicity.** Audio-Only participants rated words higher (M ≈ 4.50) than both script conditions (M ≈ 4.15) - seeing kana (congruent *or* incongruent) slightly reduced perceived iconicity for non-readers. Direction was unexpected: script acted as noise/distraction, not reinforcement.
- **Guess–rating dissociation mirrors McLean, Dunn & Dingemanse (2023):** ratings and guessing accuracy capture different, complementary dimensions of iconicity. Showcase items: **sakutto (a9)** high on both; **dokidoki (i9)** highest-rated of all (~5.8) but only modest accuracy (~67%); **shobon (i2)** hardest to guess (36%) despite moderate (~4.0) rating.
- Per-item accuracy spread: ~94% (easiest, a9) down to 36% (hardest, i2). Auditory items like **gishigishi (a7)** exceeded 80%.
- Qualitative color: participants described matching "the shape of the letters" to sounds ("rounded for softer words", "sharp/angular for harsher words"); others ignored script entirely ("I only concentrated on the audio recordings").

## 4. Per-pairing Choosing accuracy (Figure 10) - correct answers out of 36

**Exact values, verified against the full raw dataset (n=36, 1,080 trials; 2026-06-12).** The chart-read estimates originally compiled from Figure 10 proved correct for all 30 pairs (zero deltas). Pairing codes match the seed stimulus prefixes (e.g. `a0h-gosogoso`).

| Rank | Pair | Words (hira / kata) | Correct/36 | ≈% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | a9 | mogomogo / sakutto | 34 | 94% |
| 2 | a7 | doshidoshi / gishigishi | 30 | 83% |
| 3 | v2 | donyori / kirakira | 30 | 83% |
| 4 | i3 | sukkiri / iraira | 29 | 81% |
| 5 | v8 | marumaru / garigari | 27 | 75% |
| 6 | a2 | zyaazyaa / potapota | 26 | 72% |
| 7 | v0 | kukkiri / tiratira | 26 | 72% |
| 8 | a0 | gosogoso / katakata | 25 | 69% |
| 9 | v7 | bonyari / kiritto | 25 | 69% |
| 10 | i5 | nobinobi / harahara | 25 | 69% |
| 11 | a3 | ziriziri / syakisyaki | 24 | 67% |
| 12 | a6 | dosari / katitto | 24 | 67% |
| 13 | v5 | busuri / nikoniko | 24 | 67% |
| 14 | i9 | yuttari / dokidoki | 24 | 67% |
| 15 | a4 | zuruzuru / poripori | 23 | 64% |
| 16 | i0 | unzari / wakuwaku | 23 | 64% |
| 17 | a8 | bosori / kyaakyaa | 22 | 61% |
| 18 | a1 | sitosito / batyabatya | 21 | 58% |
| 19 | v1 | kurikuri / gizagiza | 21 | 58% |
| 20 | v3 | pitari / hirahira | 21 | 58% |
| 21 | i4 | tyanto / dogimagi | 21 | 58% |
| 22 | v6 | hunwari / gotugotu | 20 | 56% |
| 23 | v9 | mukumuku / bosabosa | 20 | 56% |
| 24 | i1 | gennari / gatugatu | 20 | 56% |
| 25 | i6 | nonbiri / girigiri | 20 | 56% |
| 26 | i7 | hokkori / zokuzoku | 20 | 56% |
| 27 | i8 | hotto / dokiri | 20 | 56% |
| 28 | a5 | sororisorori / dotabata | 18 | 50% |
| 29 | v4 | bissiri / barabara | 17 | 47% |
| 30 | i2 | syobon / runrun | 13 | 36% |

Note the shape: auditory pairs cluster at the top, interoceptive at the bottom, but with crossovers (i3 is 4th-easiest; a5 is at chance) - useful for "exceptions make it interesting" copy and for within-modality difficulty ordering.

## 5. Per-pairing mean iconicity ratings (Figure 14) - 7-point scale

The Rating Task rated **one word of each pair** (30 rating trials). **Confirmed from raw Gorilla data (2026-06-11): the rated word is exactly the Choosing Task's target word for that pairing** - so per-pairing accuracy and rating refer to the *same word*, making the divergence stats below clean same-word comparisons.

i9 5.81 · i5 5.00 · a4 4.97 · i3 4.92 · a3 4.86 · i8 4.78 · i7 4.75 · i4 4.67 · v0 4.64 · v7 4.58 · a1 4.53 · v5 4.42 · v3 4.39 · v8 4.36 · a5 4.28 · v2 4.14 · a2 4.11 · v6 4.11 · v9 4.06 · i2 4.03 · v1 3.94 · a7 3.89 · a9 3.86 · a0 3.78 · v4 3.78 · i6 3.72 · i1 3.58 · a6 3.28 · i0 3.25 · a8 3.22

(Exact values from the full raw dataset, 2026-06-12, replacing chart-read estimates that were accurate to ±0.05.)

Divergence highlights (rating rank vs accuracy rank): i9 (1st rated, 14th guessed), a9 (23rd rated, 1st guessed), a7 (22nd rated, 2nd guessed), i5 (2nd rated, 10th guessed). These are ready-made "your gut vs your reflection" stats for Rating Lab.

## 6. Practice items (Appendix B / Table 3) - for the practice-rounds feature

| Pair | Modality | Hiragana word | Meaning | Katakana word | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| p0 | auditory | そっと sotto | softly, gently | ガタン gatan | with a bang |
| p1 | visual | じっと zitto | motionless, fixedly | パッ patto | suddenly, in a flash |
| p2 | auditory | そろそろ sorosoro | slowly, quietly | ガンガン gangan | clanging, banging |
| p3 | visual | そっくり sokkuri | exactly alike, spitting image | ガラリ garari | completely, totally changed |

No interoceptive practice pairs existed. Practice responses were never recorded for analysis; in the thesis, practice correct answers were *not* revealed - the app may deliberately diverge here (revealing feedback on practice rounds is better game UX) but that divergence should be a conscious decision.

## 7. Fidelity notes - where the app already diverges from the thesis

1. **Prompt structure - CORRECTED 2026-06-12:** an earlier version of this doc claimed thesis trials showed only one gloss. The design-archive screenshots prove otherwise: the real trial screen showed BOTH meanings ("One of them means **X** / The other means **Y**") plus "Which one do you think means **X**?" - the app's prompt structure is a *faithful replication*, not a divergence. Furthermore, the Gorilla randomizer swapped meaning-a/meaning-b display order per participant, so the app's reserved meaning-order draw (Session B) is also thesis-faithful; wiring it into the frontend is a fidelity item, not an invention.
2. **Feedback:** thesis gave none during the Choosing Task; the app gives immediate feedback. Accepted (it's a game).
3. **Condition assignment:** thesis randomized/counterbalanced between subjects; the app lets players choose (Script Lab). Accepted, documented in project instructions.
4. **Rating coverage:** thesis rated one word per pair; Rating Lab can and probably should rate both words - note this as an extension, not a replication.
5. The seed gloss typo "feeling fo relief" originates in the thesis Appendix B itself (i3, sukkiri). Seed already fixed; thesis is the historical source.
6. **Target selection:** the thesis fixed the target word per pairing (alternating canonical script by pairing parity - see §10). The app's deterministic-shuffle roadmap item randomizes target *position*; whether to also randomize *which word is the target* is an open design decision. Randomizing it doubles the effective item pool, but thesis difficulty stats cover only the fixed targets and would no longer map one-to-one onto trials.

## 8. Difficulty-tier proposal for Modality Ladder

Two stacked signals: modality (between floors) and per-pair accuracy (within floors).

- **Floor 1 - Sound** (auditory, mean 6.86/10): order trials easy→hard within floor: a9, a7, a2, a0, a3, a6, a4, a8, a1, a5.
- **Floor 2 - Sight** (visual, 6.42/10): v2, v8, v0, v7, v5, v1, v3, v6, v9, v4.
- **Floor 3 - Inner states** (interoceptive, 5.97/10): i3, i5, i9, i0, i4, i1, i6, i7, i8, i2.
- Boss-pair flavor: end each floor with its hardest pair (a5, v4, i2) - all three sit at or below chance, which the copy can say honestly ("most players do no better than a coin flip here").
- Frame floors with the implicational hierarchy (Dingemanse 2012; McLean 2021 revised: SOUND < MOVEMENT < FORM < TEXTURE < OTHER). Future floors from inventory expansion slot in as Movement / Form / Texture between Sound and Inner states.

## 9. Landing/marketing copy facts (all verifiable against thesis)

- "People who've never studied Japanese guess these words correctly ~64% of the time. Pure chance would be 50%. Can you beat 64%?"
- "Sound words are easiest, feelings are hardest - accuracy slides from ~69% on sound words to ~60% on inner-state words." (6.86/6.42/5.97 out of 10)
- "The word people *felt* was most iconic - dokidoki, a racing heartbeat - wasn't one they could reliably guess. Your gut and your reflection disagree."
- "Seeing the Japanese script didn't help people guess - but it changed how iconic the words felt." (accuracy: no condition effect; ratings: audio-only 4.50 vs script 4.15)
- "The hardest word in the study: shobon (downhearted). Only 36% got it right - worse than flipping a coin."
- Script Lab framing rule (already in project instructions): "presentation changes the experience," never "matched script helps."

## 10. Raw-data verification - FULL dataset (combined export, analyzed 2026-06-12)

The complete data-collection archive (`data_exp_220893-vall`, Gorilla combined download) contains **all 36 thesis participants** (C1=11, C2=13, C3=12), every one complete with 30 Choosing + 30 Rating trials (1,080 + 1,080). The collection spanned versions 18–20 only: v18 → 1×C1 + 5×C2 + 4×C3 (C1 recruitment halted by the audio-only display-file bug), v19 → 6×C2 + 7×C3, v20 → 10×C1 + 2×C2 + 1×C3. The v18 C1 participant (13381142) is included in the thesis's 36. An earlier hypothesis in this doc that missing participants sat in "v21+ exports" was wrong - the earlier per-version zips were stale partial downloads. Tidy per-trial CSVs and the per-pair stats file regenerated from the full dataset are archived alongside this doc.

**Every thesis-stated statistic replicates exactly from the raw data:** overall 64.17% (19.25/30), participant range 14–27/30, modality accuracy 6.86/6.42/5.97 (aud/vis/int, /10), rating grand mean 4.256, modality ratings 4.45/4.24/4.08 (int/vis/aud), condition ratings 4.50 audio-only vs 4.15/4.15 script. The §4 accuracy table and §5 ratings are exact values from this dataset.

**Mechanisms confirmed from raw data:**
1. **Target word fixed per pairing, alternating by pairing parity**: even pairings target the hiragana-canonical word, odd pairings the katakana-canonical word. Figure 10's per-"ideophone" accuracy is per *target word*.
2. **Left/right position randomized per participant** (Gorilla "Randomise Between Columns" on word-a/word-b; the target file was pre-filled into word-a so the swap distributes it).
3. **Meaning display order randomized per participant** (same mechanism on meaning-a/meaning-b).
4. **Rated word = target word** for all 30 pairings (see §5).
5. Stimulus file scheme: `<pairing><canonical><displayed>-<romaji>.mp4`, displayed ∈ {h, k, u, d}; u/d are the audio-only placeholder symbols (▽/△).

**Reference stats the thesis never reported** (full data): Choosing RT - median 13.1 s, mean 18.4 s, p10 8.5 s, p90 31.8 s; correct and incorrect answers took essentially the same time. Largest per-pair median RT outlier: v9 (bosabosa target) at ~20.4 s. Calibration baseline for the app's `responseTimeMs`.

## 11. Remaining open items

1. ~~Locate v21+ exports~~ - resolved 2026-06-12: the full combined export contains all 36 participants within v18–v20.
2. ~~Identify the buggy v18 file~~ - resolved 2026-06-12 (author): the broken display file was `p1kd-patto.mp4`, a **practice** stimulus. Practice trials were never analyzed, so the v18 C1 participant's scored data was validly retained in N=36. The file was fixed in later versions.
3. **Dataset provenance (corrected per author, 2026-06-11):** the "top-600" list is the NLB/BCCWJ ideophone list (includes moraic structure per word). The **perceptual-strength norms are a separate dataset** (Iida & Akita 2023, ~500+ words) and were the main source of the modality classifications - with the author's caveat that many entries are arguably not ideophones or not the claimed modality, with much cross-modal overlap; classifications were used selectively to find defensible unimodal items. The pairing pipeline (roadmap step 5) therefore needs **both** datasets joined, and its modality assignments inherit the norms' noisiness - human review per generated pair is not optional.
